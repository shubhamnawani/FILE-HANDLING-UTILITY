#DESCRIPTION 

File Handling Utility - Java Program

Task Overview:

As part of my internship, I was assigned the task titled "File Handling Utility", which involved creating a Java program capable of performing core operations on text files — specifically, reading, writing, and modifying. This task was designed to provide hands-on experience with Java's file I/O mechanisms and demonstrate the practical implementation of basic file handling in real-world software development scenarios.

The Java program developed is an interactive, menu-driven console application that allows the user to choose between writing to a file, reading content from it, or modifying existing lines in the file. The file used in this program is named sample.txt and is located in the same directory as the Java source code. Users interact with the file entirely through the Java interface, making it a complete utility for simple file operations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tools and Technologies Used:

1. Programming Language
Java

2. Java Classes and APIs
FileWriter and FileReader – To write data to and read data from the file.

BufferedReader and BufferedWriter – To handle line-by-line reading and writing more efficiently.

Scanner – Used to receive user input from the console.

ArrayList – Utilized to temporarily store file content while modifying specific lines.

3. Exception Handling
Comprehensive use of try-catch blocks was implemented to handle various exceptions such as file not found, input/output errors, and invalid user input.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Editor / Development Platform Used:

The program was written and tested in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program Functionality:

The Java utility presents a command-line interface with four options:

Write to File

Accepts input from the user and writes it to sample.txt.

Each write operation overwrites the previous content entirely.

Read from File

Reads and prints each line from sample.txt, allowing users to view current content.

Modify File

Displays the file content line by line with line numbers.

The user selects a line number and provides replacement text.

The entire content is then rewritten with the modified line included.

Exit

Terminates the application gracefully.
